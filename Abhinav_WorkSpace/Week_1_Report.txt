Week 1 Report: Graph Creation and Data Management
Objective: 
My task is to model our local area as a graph for the RapidResponse prject,
representing key locations as nodes and roads as edges with weights based
on distance or travel time, along with coordinates for visualization.

Progress Made:
I have selected a small section of Clement Town and identified 4-5 initial nodes:
Hospital, Police station, Post Office, School, College.
I am planning to connect these based on real roads, using approximate distances as
weights (eg: 300 meters between College and Chemist).

Draft:
const graph = {
    "College": {"Velmed Hospital":2000, "Matritva Vardan Hospital": 2400, "Bharat Heart and Super Speciality Hospital": 2000,
    "Baunthiyal Nursing Home": 3300,"Clement Town Police Station": 1200},
    "Police Station": {"college": 1200, "Velmed Hospital": 1200}
}
/* Here "Hospital" is a Node and its Neighbors (Velmed Hospital, Matritva Vardan Hospital, Baunthiyal Nursing Home) and them respective weights.
Meaning this connects to 2 places
1.Hospitals
2.Police station






Visualizing:
 
*/
const nodePos = {
“Hospital”: {x: 50, y: 50},
“Police Station”: {x: 100, y: 100},
“College” : {x: 50, y: 150}
};

Challenges Faced: 
Estimating distances without an API is tough. I’m using rough guesses and will refine them by cross-checking with physical map.

Plan for Week 2
•	Expand to 10-15 nodes.
•	Finalize weights with better distance estimates.
•	Complete nodePos for all nodes.
•	Share graph.js with the team.
