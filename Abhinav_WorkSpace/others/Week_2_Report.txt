Week 2 Report: Graph Creation and Data Management
Objective:
To expand the RapidResponse area coverage to more real-world
locations, improve the accuracy of edge weights, and upgrade 
the graph structure to handle richer metadata such as distance, 
speed limits, and congestion levels â€” necessary for realistic 
emergency routing simulations.

Progrss Made:
 1. Graph Expanded to 10+ Nodes
-> Added new locations: Chemist, Fire Station, Library, Main Gate, Market Area, Bus Stop.
-> All nodes are interconnected based on actual or approximate road paths in Clement Town.
> Each node now connects to logical neighboring locations to simulate realistic travel.
